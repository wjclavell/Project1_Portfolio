# Project Overview

## Project Schedule

This schedule will be used to keep track of your progress throughout the week and align with our expectations.  

You are **responsible** for scheduling time with your squad to seek approval for each deliverable by the end of the corresponding day, excluding `Saturday` and `Sunday`.

|  Day | Deliverable | Status
|---|---| ---|
|Day 1| Project Description | Complete
|Day 1| Wireframes / Priority Matrix / Timeline | Complete
|Day 3| Core Application Structure (HTML, CSS, etc.) | Incomplete
|Day 4| MVP & Bug Fixes | Incomplete
|Day 5| Final Touches | Incomplete
|Day 6| Present | Incomplete


## Project Description

My final project will be a personal portfolio website. It will include my projects that I've worked on (displayed in a dropdown menu and a image carousel), an About Me section, Skills section, and Contact form. Along with a header with my monogram, navbar/hamburger at top with links for each section & my personal logo, and a footer at the bottom including links to my social media and back to top button. I will be implementing scroll animations for each section and a dark/light mode feature as well.

## Wireframes

Upload images of wireframe to cloudinary and add the link here with a description of the specific wireframe. Do not include the actual image and have it render on the page.

## Time/Priority Matrix 

List of features to be included, prioritized in a [Time and Priority Matrix](https://res.cloudinary.com/wjclavell/image/upload/v1594481600/Time-Priority-Matrix_project1.png)

Estimated time to complete: 20hrs (feel like it will definitely be more once I get started) 

Break those features into MVP and PostMVP so you can guarantee you will have a fully functioning project to demo. 

### MVP/PostMVP - 5min

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP

- Pull data using google json api
- Render data on page 
- About me, contact, projects, skills sections 
- hamburger menu on mobile
- sticky nav bar on desktop
- project carousel
- project dropdown menu
- grid layout
- flex sections
- hover description for projects
- monogram at top

#### PostMVP 

- Scroll animations
- dark/light mode
- personal logo
- custom cursor
- implement drawing app functionality into website


## Functional Components

Based on the initial logic defined in the previous sections try and breakdown the logic further into functional components, and by that we mean functions.  Try and capture what logic would need to be defined if the game was broken down into the following categories.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe.

#### MVP
| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invetsted | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Hamburger | H | 1.5hr | -hr | -hr|
| Project carousel | H | 2hr | -hr | -hr|
